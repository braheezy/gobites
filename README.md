# gobites
This project contain my Go implementations to the challenges provided by the great [Pybites](https://codechalleng.es/challenges/) team.

I did a handful of these [challenges in Python](https://github.com/braheezy/pybites) as designed. They were so effective that as I started to learn Go, they seemed like a good content to reuse.

Each Pybites challenge usually comes with some scaffolding and test code to help the student focus on the challenge itself. This must be ported to Go before the challenge can be started. While this means more typing, it's a great learning multiplier.
